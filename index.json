For example, as we encounter birds we can learn that there are shared features that link them together (birds can fly and lay eggs). But we can also learn that there are unique features that set them apart (flamingos are pink and have long legs). We tested whether or not people misremember information differently depending on whether or not it is shared or unique.\nIn short, to do this, we developed online memory games where participants memorized the colors of cartoon satellite categories. We then tested how people’s memory for colors were distorted based on whether or not that satellite part was shared or unique across satellites. We used color because it gives us a tightly-controlled and accessible way to measure how memories are being distorted. We hypothesized that if a part was shared across satellites people might misremember its color as being more similar to the color of the other satellites, a kind of with this blending of colors reflecting a memory error. In humans, we find that memory biases are strongest for information that is shared across experiences (shared features). In a neural network model trained on the same satellites, we find a strikingly similar effect where the model’s internal hidden layer representations are also distorting shared features the most. This shows that both humans and neural network models—both of which are remarkable at learning patterns—show memory errors that emerge from learning these patterns. This makes sense! If we learn that certain things in the world are related, in our mind we might represent those things similarly, making it more likely we will mix up the details . We are now testing this directly in the human brain by having people play the same memory games, but while lying inside an MRI scanner.\nI was fortunate to have the opportunity to present this work as a talk at Neuroscience \u0026#39;22 in San Diego, one of the biggest science conferences in the world.

But usually air quality has been studied outdoors and these harmful effects emerge across years. Because we spend so much time inside (such as at work), we were interested in how everyday exposure to air pollutants indoors negatively impact cognitive performance in real-time.\nWith a cross-functional team of engineers, chemists, psychologists, and neuroscientists, we conducted systematic literature reviews and also collected in-lab experimental evidence to test how indoor air quality impacts cognition. In lab, we carefully manipulated air quality while participants were performing different cognitive tasks that I designed. We found evidence that both CO2 and lemon essential oils (from a diffuser) have detrimental effects on decision-making. Our work has been cited by engineers, psychologists, educators, and architects.

But it is another to take what you learn and transfer it to new scenarios, such as applying a math concept to solve a new problem or improvising in live jazz. Because of known differences in brain activity throughout the day, we were interested in how time of day affects this ability to learn and generalize information. Across 7 experiments, we brought in 331 undergraduates into the lab either in the morning (8am) or evening (8pm) and had them learn new concepts, in which they had to later generalize what they learned to new scenarios. We found that people generalized much better in the morning than in the evening. This is consistent with neuroscientific findings showing that the brains has reduced inhibitory control in the morning. We speculate that this state of low inhibition could help you flexibly transfer what you learn to new scenarios (generalize) because of more spreading activation across memories—helping you connect the dots and uncover new patterns.\n","date":1666828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666828800,"objectID":"be4ee2f17059f250dc4cfa148da47ece","permalink":"https://marlietandoc.github.io/project/tod/","publishdate":"2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tod/","section":"project","summary":"Not a morning person?

By comparing how children and adults learn in the lab, we discover a reason why this could be. We find that children and adults pay attention to and process information in very different ways. Children pay attention to their environments in a more holistic and open-minded fashion, thus taking in more information from the worlds around them, kind of like a sponge. On the other hand, adults selectively attend to only one source of information and ignore and filter out everything else. While this can be beneficial for the task-at-hand, it does mean adults are processing and learning less from the environment.

Moreover, the chemicals and fragrances emitted by those products may affect the central nervous system and cognitive function. This study uses a double-blind between-subject design to investigate the cognitive impact of exposure to the emissions from essential oil used in an ultrasonic diffuser. In a simulated office environment where other environmental parameters were maintained constant, 34 female and 25 male university students were randomly allocated into four essential oil exposure scenarios. The first two scenarios contrast lemon oil to pure deionized water, while the latter two focus on different levels of particulate matter differentiated by HEPA filters with non-scented grapeseed oil as the source. Cognitive function was assessed using a computer-based battery consisting of five objective tests that involve reasoning, response inhibition, memory, risk-taking, and decision-making. Results show that exposure to essential oil emissions caused shortened reaction time at the cost of significantly worse response inhabitation control and memory sensitivity, indicating potentially more impulsive decision-making. The cognitive responses caused by scented lemon oil and non-scented grapeseed oil were similar, as was the perception of odor pleasantness and intensity.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of emissions from an essential oil diffuser on cognitive performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":163944e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":163944e4,"objectID":"daa1ab59f3926bad4cc3bc9ed346b324","permalink":"https://marlietandoc.github.io/fun_projects/tote/","publishdate":"2021-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fun_projects/tote/","section":"fun_projects","summary":"I printed a couple hundred of these for an international conference on memory.

Distributed representations support powerful learning in neural network models and have been posited to exist throughout the brain, but it is unclear under what conditions humans acquire these representations and what computational advantages they may confer. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved exposure to new information facilitates the rapid formation of distributed representations in humans. As in neural network models with distributed representations, interleaved learning supports fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference.

This review summarizes the results from 37 experimental studies that conducted objective cognitive tests with manipulated CO2 concentrations, either through adding pure CO2 or adjusting ventilation rates (the latter also affects other indoor pollutants). Studies with varied designs suggested that both approaches can affect multiple cognitive functions. In a subset of studies that meet objective criteria for strength and consistency, pure CO2 at a concentration common in indoor environments was only found to affect high-level decision-making measured by the Strategic Management Simulation battery in non-specialized populations, while lower ventilation and accumulation of indoor pollutants, including CO2, could reduce the speed of various functions but leave accuracy unaffected. Major confounding factors include variations in cognitive assessment methods, study designs, individual and populational differences in subjects, and uncertainties in exposure doses. Accordingly, future research is suggested to adopt direct air delivery for precise control of CO2 inhalation, include brain imaging techniques to better understand the underlying mechanisms that link CO2 and cognitive function, and explore the potential interaction between CO2 and other environmental stimuli.","tags":[],"title":"Indoor CO2 concentrations and cognitive function: A critical review","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
