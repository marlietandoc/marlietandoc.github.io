Moreover, the chemicals and fragrances emitted by those products may affect the central nervous system and cognitive function. This study uses a double-blind between-subject design to investigate the cognitive impact of exposure to the emissions from essential oil used in an ultrasonic diffuser. In a simulated office environment where other environmental parameters were maintained constant, 34 female and 25 male university students were randomly allocated into four essential oil exposure scenarios. The first two scenarios contrast lemon oil to pure deionized water, while the latter two focus on different levels of particulate matter differentiated by HEPA filters with non-scented grapeseed oil as the source. Cognitive function was assessed using a computer-based battery consisting of five objective tests that involve reasoning, response inhibition, memory, risk-taking, and decision-making. Results show that exposure to essential oil emissions caused shortened reaction time at the cost of significantly worse response inhabitation control and memory sensitivity, indicating potentially more impulsive decision-making. The cognitive responses caused by scented lemon oil and non-scented grapeseed oil were similar, as was the perception of odor pleasantness and intensity.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of emissions from an essential oil diffuser on cognitive performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639958400,"objectID":"daa1ab59f3926bad4cc3bc9ed346b324","permalink":"https://marlietandoc.github.io/fun_projects/tote/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fun_projects/tote/","section":"fun_projects","summary":"I printed a couple hundred of these for an international conference on memory.

Distributed representations support powerful learning in neural network models and have been posited to exist throughout the brain, but it is unclear under what conditions humans acquire these representations and what computational advantages they may confer. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved exposure to new information facilitates the rapid formation of distributed representations in humans. As in neural network models with distributed representations, interleaved learning supports fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference. The results demonstrate the power of interleaved learning and implicate the use of distributed representations in human inference.","tags":[],"title":"Distributed representations for human inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlie Tandoc","Mollie Bayda","Craig Poskanzer","Eileen Cho","Robert Stickgold","Anna Schapiro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"965112be39d57e38c7315ec661ff5e13","permalink":"https://marlietandoc.github.io/publication/tod/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tod/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Examining the effects of time of day and sleep on generalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlie Tandoc","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

This review summarizes the results from 37 experimental studies that conducted objective cognitive tests with manipulated CO2 concentrations, either through adding pure CO2 or adjusting ventilation rates (the latter also affects other indoor pollutants). Studies with varied designs suggested that both approaches can affect multiple cognitive functions. In a subset of studies that meet objective criteria for strength and consistency, pure CO2 at a concentration common in indoor environments was only found to affect high-level decision-making measured by the Strategic Management Simulation battery in non-specialized populations, while lower ventilation and accumulation of indoor pollutants, including CO2, could reduce the speed of various functions but leave accuracy unaffected. Major confounding factors include variations in cognitive assessment methods, study designs, individual and populational differences in subjects, and uncertainties in exposure doses. Accordingly, future research is suggested to adopt direct air delivery for precise control of CO2 inhalation, include brain imaging techniques to better understand the underlying mechanisms that link CO2 and cognitive function, and explore the potential interaction between CO2 and other environmental stimuli.","tags":[],"title":"Indoor CO2 concentrations and cognitive function: A critical review","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
