Do we learn better in the AM or PM?</title><link>https://marlietandoc.github.io/project/tod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marlietandoc.github.io/project/tod/</guid><description>&lt;p>Extracting shared structure across our experiences allows us to generalize our knowledge to novel contexts. How do different brain states influence this ability to generalize? Using a novel category learning paradigm, we assess the effect of both sleep and time of day on generalization that depends on the flexible integration of recent information. Counter to our expectations, we found no evidence that this form of generalization is better after a night of sleep relative to a day awake. Instead, we observed an effect of time of day, with better generalization in the morning than the evening. We suggest that a state of lowered inhibition in the morning may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promotinggeneralization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>suggesting that in the morning inhibition in the brain is reduced allowing you to transfer what you learned to new scenarios.&lt;/p>

But only recently have we started to test how air quality impacts cognitive outcomes in real-time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We researched how CO2 (as well as essential oil emissions) are detrimental for certain kinds of decision-making. And found evidence that both CO2 (in a systematic review) and a common household product (essential oils) hurt decision-making. This work provides key insights into why ventilation is critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and even high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships!), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

&lt;p>&lt;strong> My Role: &lt;/strong>As a psychology researcher, my role on this project was to develop, code up (Python), and administer a battery of 6 tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive perfroamnce, collaborate with engineers and chemists to design an experiment and conduct a thoughtful literature review, as well as to collect, and analyze behavioral data (A/B test). I worked closely with engineers to advocate for how human/user psychology works and interact while integrating their design constraints into our research plans. How do design experiments and surveys that humans can intuiively interact with. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), an initiative meant to tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
