For example, as we encounter birds we can learn that there are shared features that link them together (birds can fly and lay eggs). But we can also learn that there are unique features that set them apart (flamingos are pink and have long legs). We tested whether or not people misremember things differently depending on whether or not it is shared across experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, to do this, we created online memory games where participants memorized the colors of cartoon satellite categories. We then tested how people&amp;rsquo;s memory for colors were distorted based on whether or not that satellite part was shared or unique across satellites . We used color because it gives us an tightly-controlled and accessible way to measure how memories are being distorted.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hypothesized that if a part was shared across satellites then you might misremember its color as being more similar to those other satellites, a kind of memory error or false memory. We also trained a biologically-plausible neural network model on the same satellites to see if it would also show this memory error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In humans, we find that memory biases are strongest for information that is shared across experiences (shared features). In the neural network model, we find a strikingly similar effect where the model&amp;rsquo;s internal hidden layer representations are also distorting shared features the most.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This shows that both humans and neural network models—both of which are remarkable at learning patterns—show memory errors that emerge from learning these patterns.This makes sense! &lt;strong> If we learn that certain things in the world are related, in our mind we might represent those things similarily, making it more likely we will mix up the details &amp;lt;/strong?. We are now collecting neuroimaging data (fMRI) where we will examine how these memory biases manifest from human brain activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong> My Role: &lt;/strong> As part of my PhD work I led experimental design, programmed the experiments, assisted in securing grant funding, created the stimuli, collected data online, wrangled/analyzed data in R, and developed neuroimaging analysis pipelines. I also recently presented this work as a talk at
&lt;a href="https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2022" target="_blank">Neuroscience '22 in San Diego&lt;/a>
, one of the biggest science conferences in the world.

But usually air quality has been studied outdoors and the health consequences emerge over many years. Because we spend so much time inside (such as at work), we tested how everyday exposure we have to air pollutants indoors negatively impact cognitive performance in real-time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a cross-functional team of engineers, chemists, psychologists, and neuroscientists, we have conducted both systematic literature reviews and run in-lab experiments where we can carefully control air quality. We have found evidence that both CO2 and lemon essential oils seem to have detrimental effects on decision-making. Ventilation is thus critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and this is something studied too in high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong> My Role:As the psychologist on this project, I developed, programmed, and administered a battery of 6 cognitive tasks to participants that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive performance. I worked closely with engineers and chemists to design tightly controlled experiments and I advised on psychological topics in a literature review. Throughout this project, I worked closely with engineers and advocated for how human/user psychology works. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), a conference meant for students to present work that tackles complex, multidisciplinary challenges. &lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

I also wrote up the
&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255423" target="_blank">paper&lt;/a>
and made the figures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is one thing to remember information. But it is another to take what you know and transfer it to new scenarios. Think applying a math concept to solve a new problem or improvising in live jazz. Because of known differences in brain activity throughout the day, we were interested how time of day affects this ability to generalize. Across 7 experiments, we brought in 331 undergraduates into the lab either in the morning (8am) or evening (8pm) and had them learn new concepts, in which they had to later generalize to never-before-encountered scenarios. We found much better generalization in the morning than the evening. Consistent with what we know about the brain, this work suggests that reduced neuronal inhibition can help you transfer what you learned to new scenarios.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MDRS '22 conference totes</title><link>https://marlietandoc.github.io/fun_projects/tote/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marlietandoc.github.io/fun_projects/tote/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
