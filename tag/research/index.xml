&lt;p>&lt;strong> My Role: &lt;/strong>As a psychology researcher, my role on this project was to develop, code up (Python), and administer a battery of 6 tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive perfroamnce, collaborate with engineers and chemists to design an experiment and conduct a thoughtful literature review, as well as to collect, and analyze behavioral data (A/B test). I worked closely with engineers to advocate for how human/user psychology works and interact while integrating their design constraints into our research plans. How do design experiments and surveys that humans can intuiively interact with. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), an initiative meant to tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance</title><link>https://marlietandoc.github.io/project/iaq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marlietandoc.github.io/project/iaq/</guid><description>&lt;p>Poor air quality is related to all sorts of health consequences. But only recently have we started to test how air quality impacts cognitive outcomes in real-time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We researched how CO2 (as well as essential oil emissions) are detrimental for certain kinds of decision-making. And found evidence that both CO2 (in a systematic review) and a common household product (essential oils) hurt decision-making. This work provides key insights into why ventilation is critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and even high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships!), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

Using a concept learning task, we assess the effect of time of day on generalization in 331 undergraduates who were brought into the lab either in the morning (9am) or evening (9pm). We found with better generalization in the morning than the evening. Consistent with work that the brain is in a lower state of lowered inhibition in the mornin, may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promoting generalization and transfer to new contexts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>suggesting that in the morning inhibition in the brain is reduced allowing you to transfer what you learned to new scenarios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My role: Wrote the paper, made figures and visualizations (ggplot2, Illustrator), analyzed data and performed statistics (regression, correlation, ANOVA),
