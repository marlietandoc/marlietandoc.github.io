abstract: Children sometimes learn distracting information better than adults do, perhaps because of the development of selective attention. To understand this potential link, we ask how the learning of children (aged 7-9 years) and the learning of adults differ when information is the directed focus of attention versus when it is not. Participants viewed drawings of common objects and were told to attend to the drawings (Experiment 1: 42 children, 35 adults) or indicate when shapes (overlaid on the drawings) repeated (Experiment 2: 53 children, 60 adults). Afterward, participants identified fragments of these drawings as quickly as possible. Adults learned better than children when directed to attend to the drawings; however, when drawings were task irrelevant, children showed better learning than adults in the first half of the test. And although directing attention to the drawings improved learning in adults, children learned the drawings similarly across experiments regardless of whether the drawings were the focus of the task or entirely irrelevant.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: <strong>Kids are amazing learners:</strong> They learn language better than adults do and tend to remember details that an adult would deem irrelevant. (“That koi fish was hairy!?”) These unique strengths in learning could be the consequence of children’s worse attention; it could be that attention just matters less for children’s learning. We asked children (aged 7–9 years) and adults to learn about drawings when the drawings were the focus of attention versus when they were irrelevant to other tasks we asked them to complete, and this is exactly what we found. Unlike adults, who learned better when we asked them to pay attention, we found that children learned information equally well when we asked them to focus on it and when we asked them to do something else entirely. These results suggest that <strong>a sponge </strong> may be a good metaphor for learning during childhood: <strong> Children appear to take things in regardless of whether they are trying to or not. </strong>
