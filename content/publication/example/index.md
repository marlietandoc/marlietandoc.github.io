abstract: Children sometimes learn distracting information better than adults do, perhaps because of the development of selective attention. To understand this potential link, we ask how the learning of children (aged 7-9 years) and the learning of adults differ when information is the directed focus of attention versus when it is not. Participants viewed drawings of common objects and were told to attend to the drawings (Experiment 1, 42 children, 35 adults) or indicate when shapes (overlaid on the drawings) repeated (Experiment 2, 53 children, 60 adults). Afterward, participants identified fragments of these drawings as quickly as possible. Adults learned better than children when directed to attend to the drawings; however, when drawings were task irrelevant, children showed better learning than adults in the first half of the test. And although directing attention to the drawings improved learning in adults, children learned the drawings similarly across experiments regardless of whether the drawings were the focus of the task or entirely irrelevant.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: <strong>Why can kids seemingly learn so much without even trying? </strong> By comparing how children and adults learn in the lab, we discover a reason why this could be. We find that children and adults pay attention to and process information in very different ways. <strong> Children pay attention to their environments in a more holistic and open-minded fashion</strong>, thus taking in more information from the worlds around them, kind of like a sponge. On the other hand, adults selectively attend to only one source of information and ignore and filter out everything else. While this can be beneficial for the task-at-hand, it does mean adults are processing and learning less from the environment. Together, this suggests that <strong> children learn so much because they are processing more information than adults.</strong>
