For <strong> 6+ years</strong>, I have conducted a wide-range of collaborative research projects on human behavior and cognition. I am currently a PhD Student at UPenn in the {{< staticref "https://www.schapirolab.org/home" "newtab" >}}Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab {{< /staticref >}} where we integrate behavioral studies, neuroimaging, and neural networks to improve understanding of how humans learn.

I love working as a team to identify research questions, to develop innovative and interdisciplinary research methods, and to uncover data-driven stories to share with others. I am <strong> currently seeking an internship in Summer '23 </strong> where I can continue to grow as a researcher.
