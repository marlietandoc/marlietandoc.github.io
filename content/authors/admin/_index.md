For 6+ years, I have led collaborative research on <strong> human behavior and cognition. </strong> I am currently a PhD Student at UPenn in the {{< staticref "https://www.schapirolab.org/home" "newtab" >}}Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab {{< /staticref >}} where we create harmonies with behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and brain-inspired neural networks to improve our understanding of how people think, learn, and remember.

 I am currently seeking an internship I can grow as a researcher, apply my research craft, and solve problems with a team.
