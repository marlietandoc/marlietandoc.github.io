For 6+ years, I have led collaborative research on <strong> human behavior, cognition, and decision-making </strong>. I currently work in the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience lab at UPenn where we create harmonies with behavioral studies, neuroimaging, and machine learning to better understand how people think, learn, and remember.

Learning doesn't always come easy. We all have moments where it feels harder to pay attention and make optimal decisions. I have researched an assortment of factors that impact learning. How does time of day and sleep quality affect learning? What about when we are trying to multi-task? How about CO2 levels or your lemon essential oil diffuser?
