Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania with 6+ years of mixed methods research on human behavior and decision-making. I work in the Penn Computational Cognitive Neuroscience lab where we integrate behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and neural network modelling to understand how humans learn. I am currently seeking an internship in Summer 2023 where I can grow as a researcher, translate my quanitiative and qualitative research kills to provide data-driven insights on real problems.

Learning and thinking doesn't always come easy. What factors affect this?
How does the time of day affect what we learn? How does indoor air quality, C02 and, eseential oils? How about sleep quality?
