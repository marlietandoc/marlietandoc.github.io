title: Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance
summary: In this wide-scale interdisciplinary collaboration between psychologists, engineers, and chemists, we are researching how indoor air quality (CO2) and common household products (such as essential oil diffusers) impact everyday cognition and decision-making. This work provides actionable insights into why good building ventilation is so important.

Poor air quality is related to all sorts of health consequences. But only recently have we started to test how everyday exposure to air pollutants indoors might impact cognitive performance.

With a cross-functional team of engineers, chemists, psychologists, and neuroscientits we researched how CO2 (as well as essential oil emissions) are detrimental for certain kinds of decision-making. And found evidence that both CO2 (in a review paper) and a common household product (essential oils) hurt decision-making. This work provides key insights into why ventilation is critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and even high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships!), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

<strong> My Role: </strong>As the psychologist on this project, I developed, coded up, and administered a battery of 6 cognitive tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive performance. I worked closely with engineers and chemists to design experiments and to advise on psychological topics in a literature review. I worked closely with engineers to advocate for how human/user psychology works. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), an initiative meant to tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.
