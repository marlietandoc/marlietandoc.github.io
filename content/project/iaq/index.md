title: Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance
summary: From school to work, we spend a lot of time indoors. In this wide-scale collaboration between psychologists, engineers, and chemists, we are researching how indoor air quality (CO2 levels and household products), impacts everyday cognition and decision-making. This work provides actionable insights into why good building ventilation is so important.

Poor air quality is related to all sorts of health consequences. But usually air quality has been studied outdoors and the health consequences emerge over many years. Because we spend so much time inside (such as at work), we tested how everyday exposure we have to air pollutants indoors negatively impact cognitive performance in real-time.

With a cross-functional team of engineers, chemists, psychologists, and neuroscientists, we have conducted both systematic literature reviews and run in-lab experiments where we can carefully control air quality. We have found evidence that both CO2 and lemon essential oils seem to have detrimental effects on decision-making. Ventilation is thus critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and this is something studied too in high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

<strong> My Role:As the psychologist on this project, I developed, programmed, and administered a battery of 6 cognitive tasks to participants that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive performance. I worked closely with engineers and chemists to design tightly controlled experiments and I advised on psychological topics in a literature review. Throughout this project, I worked closely with engineers and advocated for how human/user psychology works. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), a conference meant for students to present work that tackles complex, multidisciplinary challenges. </strong>
