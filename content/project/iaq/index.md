title: Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance and decision-making
summary: In this large interdisciplinary collaboration between psychologists, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists, we are researching how indoor air quality (CO2) and essential oil diffusers impact everyday cognition and optimal decision-making, providing actionable insights into the need for good ventilation.

Poor air quality is related to all sorts of health consequences in the long-term. But only recently have we started to test how air quality impacts cognitive outcomes in real-time.

In a systematic review CO2 and in empriical investigation we essential oil emissions are detrimental for certain kinds of decision-making such as the ability to inhibit incorrect responses. This work provides key insights into why ventilation is critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and even high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

As a psychology researcher, my role on this project was to develop and code up (Python)a battery of 6 cognitive tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive perfroamnce, collaborate with engineers and chemists to design an experiment and conduct a literature review, as well as to collect and analyze behavioral data (A/B test).

I also presented earlier versions of these finding a XSEED an interdiscplinary collaborative conference in Toronto, Canada:
