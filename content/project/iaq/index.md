title: Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance
summary: From school to work, we spend a lot of time indoors. In this <strong> wide-scale collaboration</strong> between psychologists, engineers, and chemists, we are researching how everyday fluctuations in indoor air quality impacts cognition. We find that CO2, as well as common household fragrance products, negatively impact decision-making. This work provides actionable insights into why good building ventilation is so important.

<strong>My Role</strong>: I developed, programmed, and administered 6 cognitive tasks that tap into different types of cognition. I worked closely with engineers and chemists to design studies according to their constraints, while also advocating for human/user psychology and how cognition works. For the literature review, I contributed towards operationalizing what kinds of tasks were used in prior studies and what cognitive measures (i.e. attention, memory, etc.) they were assessing.

<strong> Summary</strong>: Poor air quality is related to many health consequences. But usually air quality has been studied outdoors and health consequences emerge across years. Because we spend so much time inside (such as at work), we tested how everyday exposure we have to air pollutants indoors negatively impact cognitive performance in real-time.

With a cross-functional team of engineers, chemists, psychologists, and neuroscientists, we conducted systematic literature reviews and also in-lab experiments where we carefully controlled air quality while participants perform different cognitive tasks. We have found evidence that both CO2 and lemon essential oils (from a diffuser)have detrimental effects on decision-making. Ventilation is thus critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and this is something studied too in high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

 I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), a conference meant for students to present work that tackles complex, multidisciplinary challenges.
