title: Impacts of indoor air quality on cognitive performance
summary: In this large interdisciplinary collaboration between psychologists, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists, we are researching how everyday indoor air quality (CO2) and everyday household products (essential oils diffusers) impact everyday cognition and optimal decision-making, providing actionable insights into why good ventilation is so important.

Poor air quality is related to all sorts of health consequences. But only recently have we started to test how air quality impacts cognitive outcomes in real-time.

We researched how CO2 (as well as essential oil emissions) are detrimental for certain kinds of decision-making. And found evidence that both CO2 (in a systematic review) and a common household product (essential oils) hurt decision-making. This work provides key insights into why ventilation is critical for building design, such as in workplaces, schools, and even high-stakes environment (like submarines and spaceships!), as decision-making may otherwise be impaired.

<strong> My Role: </strong>As a psychology researcher, my role on this project was to develop, code up (Python), and administer a battery of 6 tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive perfroamnce, collaborate with engineers and chemists to design an experiment and conduct a thoughtful literature review, as well as to collect, and analyze behavioral data (A/B test). I worked closely with engineers to advocate for how human/user psychology works and interact while integrating their design constraints into our research plans. How do design experiments and surveys that humans can intuiively interact with. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), an initiative meant to tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.
