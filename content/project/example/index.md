title: Memory errors in behavior, brains, and machines
summary: Our memories are not perfect recordings of the past. But are prone to bias and misinformation. As part of my PhD work, I have been identifying what kind of memories are most susceptible to such biases. By combining behavioral experiments, fMRI, and neural networks, we show that memory biases similarly exist in humans and machines. And we find, that these are not just random errors, but are a product of an optimal learning system.

I recently presented this work as a talk at {{< staticref "https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2022" "newtab" >}} Neuroscience '22.{{< /staticref >}}, one of the biggest science conferences in the world.

<strong> My Role: </strong>As a psychology researcher, my role on this project was to develop, code up (Python), and administer a battery of 6 tasks that tap into meaningful markers of cognitive perfroamnce, collaborate with engineers and chemists to design an experiment and conduct a thoughtful literature review, as well as to collect, and analyze behavioral data (A/B test). I worked closely with engineers to advocate for how human/user psychology works and interact while integrating their design constraints into our research plans. How do design experiments and surveys that humans can intuiively interact with. I also presented earlier versions of this work at a XSEED conference (Toronto, Canada), an initiative meant to tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.
