title: When is the best time to learn?
summary:  Not a morning person? Most people below the age of 30 would say so. But, in this collaboration with Harvard Medical School, we tested whether or not college students do in fact learn and process information worse in the morning. Remarkably, we find that <strong> the morning is actually the best time to learn new information</strong>, especially when we have to go beyond what we learned, and transfer it to new scenarios.

<strong>My role</strong>: As part of my Master's thesis, I wrangled, analyzed, and visualized data from 7 experiments. I also wrote up the {{< staticref "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255423" "newtab" >}}paper{{< /staticref >}} and made the figures. 

<strong> Summary</strong>: It is one thing to remember information. But it is another to take what you learn and transfer it to new scenarios, such as applying a math concept to solve a new problem or improvising in live jazz. Because of known differences in brain activity throughout the day, we were interested in how time of day affects this ability to learn and generalize information. Across 7 experiments, we brought in 331 undergraduates into the lab either in the morning (8am) or evening (8pm) and had them learn new concepts, in which they had to later generalize what they learned to never-before-encountered scenarios. We found that people generalized much better in the morning than in the evening. This is consistent with findings that the brain's has reduced inhibitory control in the morning, which could help you transfer what you learn to new scenarios due to more spreading activation and excitation across memories.
