title: Identifying the best time to learn
summary:  Not a morning person? Most below the age of 30 think so. In a collaboration with Harvard Medical School, we tested if the ability for college students to learn and process new information is in fact worse in the morning. Remarkably, we find that the morning is actually the best time to learn new information, especially when we have to go beyond what we learned, and transfer it to new scenarios.

It is one thing to remember information. But it is another to take what you know and transfer it to new scenarios. Like applying a math concept to solve  new problem or being ability to improvise in jazz in the right scales. We have known for a while that brain activity fluctuates systematically throughout across the 24-hour clock. We were interested how time of day (and sleep) affects this ability to generalize. Across 7 experiments, we brought in 331 undergraduates into the lab either in the morning (8am) or evening (8pm). We found with better generalization in the morning than the evening. Consistent with work that the brain is in a state of low inhibitory control in the morning, this means that the brain is in a state where it is letting  separate memories, promoting generalization and transfer to new contexts. We didn't find that sleep helped generalization.

 suggesting that in the morning inhibition in the brain is reduced allowing you to transfer what you learned to new scenarios.

My role: As part of my Master's thesis, I wrangled, analyzed, and visualized data across 7 experiments. I also wrote the paper.
