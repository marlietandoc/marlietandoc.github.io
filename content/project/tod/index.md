title: When is the best time of day to learn?
summary:  Not a morning person? Most below the age of 30 think so. In a collab with Harvard Medical School, we tested if college student's ability to learn and process new information is actually worse in the morning. We find that the morning is in fact the best time to learn new information, especially when we have to apply what we learned to new scenarios.

It is one thing to remember information. But it is another to take what you know and transfer it to new scenarios. Like transferring a math concept to solve  new problem or being ability to improvise in jazz in the right scales. A lot of the time this flexible cognition is what we think as peak cognition. Because of known differences in brain activity around the clock, we were inteested how time of day (and sleep) affects the ability to generalize. Across 7 experiments, we tested the effect of time of day on generalization, that is the ability to learn new concepts and transfer it to new settings (kind of like when you study one math problem but need to generalize it tanother one. We brought in 331 undergraduates into the lab either in the morning (9am) or evening (9pm). We found with better generalization in the morning than the evening. Consistent with work that the brain is in a state of low inhibitory control in the morning, this means that the brain is in a state where it is letting  separate memories, promoting generalization and transfer to new contexts. We didn't find that sleep helped generalization.

 suggesting that in the morning inhibition in the brain is reduced allowing you to transfer what you learned to new scenarios.

My role: As part of my Master's thesis, I wrangled, analyzed, and visualized data across 7 experiments. I also wrote the paper.
